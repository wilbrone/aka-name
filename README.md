As a team, go through your user stories and write BDD scenarios using the keywords GIVEN, WHEN, and THEN (AND, BUT can be used as well)
GIVEN is your setup; for example, “GIVEN the credit card is valid”
WHEN is your action; for example, “WHEN I request $50”
THEN is your assertion; for example, “THEN the ATM should dispense $50”
Capture the BDD scenarios in a location that is public for everyone to see. Hiptest is a good choice
